Understanding The Widget Tree

In chapter 1 , the Understanding Widget Tree has already mentioned together with the Element tree, but they just give a short but direct meaning about them because they where focusing on other topics. But in this chapter, we'll learned the unmention Understanding Widget Tree in chapter 1. So, Widget Tree is the result of nested widgets. When we increase the number of widgets, the widget tree expands quickly and lessens code readability and manageability. I've learned that each widget describes as a part of the user interface, such as buttons, containers, or text elements. Additionally, Widget tree is immutable, that means that once we've created it doesn't change.

In this chapter, I've try how to create the full widget tree. I must say that putting those code in Flutter app has given me a hard time, even though there was a code already. But at the end, finally I was able to run it. 


By refactoring into smaller widget classes, I can leverage Flutter's efficient subtree rebuilding process, which helps enhance performance.
